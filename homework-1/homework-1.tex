%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
	In this paper we present the information retrieval system we developed for the 2022 Touché @ CLEF Task 2 evaluation campaign.\\
	This tasks' aim is to create systems that are able to retrieve documents that compare two options, e.g. which is the best pet between a dog and a cat.\\
	Here we describe the architecture of our system, we list the software and hardware resources we made use of, we discuss the results obtained using different configurations and finally we present improvements which could be applied to our system to enhance it's performance.
