By DANIEL E. SLOTNIK 6:08 p.m. | Updated A statement from Princeton was added to the story. The Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights is examining complaints thatHarvard and Princeton have discriminated against Asian-American undergraduate applicants, highlighting a concern of many Asian-American parents. The inquiry was first reported by Bloomberg News.<query> do asian americans face bias in admissions<\/query>",

For Asian-Americans, I say take heart. Competition only makes you stronger. And who cares about the Ivy League, their mission is never to educate the best. Their main mission is to live off their \u201cold money\u201d prestige by rubber stamping the diploma of the offsprings of the rich and powerful, before ushering them into pre-ordained careers on Wall Street and Washington DC to further enhance the schools reputation and future coffer. A few \u201ccolored folks\u201d get to come along for the ride just so they could claim equality. At the end of the day, an ivy league degree only matters if you want to a degree of the idle rich, i.e. a liberal arts degree, before going into law, wall street, politics or academia, all are careers that depend heavily on connections.<query> why is the ivy league important<\/query>",

February 8, 2012 3:34 pm Link I agree that it is most likely a myth. As is the completely academically focused Asian with no ECs. I think it\u2019s likely that, as one person in the article pointed out, Asians as a group score higher on standardized tests and maybe even GPA. Yet if schools truly do a holistic review of candidates and pick them on an overall basis, if one were to look only at scores, it would look like Asians were being unfairly discriminated against.<query> what is the best school for stem<\/query>",

Schools do want more than just test scores these days, for better or for worse. They want a \u201cwell-rounded student body\u201d they say. Admissions at elite colleges is so difficult anymore, it\u2019s no wonder that people look for reasons.
